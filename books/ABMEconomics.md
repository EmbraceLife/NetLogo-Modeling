#### Early Key Economists don't use fancy math and models 

> The Method I take to do this, is not yet very usual; for instead of using only compar- ative and superlative Words, and intellectual Arguments, I have taken the course (as a Specimen of the Political Arithmetick I have long aimed at) to express my self in Terms of Number, Weight, or Measure; to use only Arguments of Sense, and to consider only such Causes, as have visible Foundations in Nature.
> Sir William Petty (1690)
> Whether Sir William Petty was the first economic modeller is arguable. Was Quesnay’s Tableau Economique dated 1767 the first macroeconomic model? Or Ricardo’s 1821 model of a farm the first microeconomic model? (Those interested in these early models should read Morgan, 2012, pp.3–8.) Nevertheless, books of political economy such as <u>Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776) or Marshall’s Principles of Economics (1920) had **no modelling or mathematics**</u>. There is **almost none** in <u>Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936).</u>  p. 2

#### macroeconomic models : a set of equations and law of aggregates and averages 

> Traditional macroeconomic models
> For our purposes, we shall start with the <u>macroeconomic models produced in the 1930s by Frisch and Tinbergen</u> (Morgan, 2012, p.10). These models comprised <u>a set of equations relying on correlations between time series generated from the national accounts</u>. There was no formal link between these macroeconomic models and microeconomic analysis despite the traditional view that ‘<u>the laws of the aggregate depend of course upon the laws applying to individual cases’</u> (Jevons, 1888, Chapter 3, para 20). Not all saw benefit in these new models. For example, Hayek (1931, p.5) wrote:
> ...<u>neither aggregates nor averages do act upon each other, and it will never be possible to establish necessary connections of cause and effect between them</u> as we can between individual phenomena, individual prices, etc. I would even go as far as to assert that, from the very nature of economic theory, averages can never form a link in its reasoning.
> Nevertheless, macroeconomics became identified as separate field from microeconomics with the publication of Samuelson’s Economics in 1948 (Colander, 2006, p.52). p. 2

#### DSGE : microFoundationMacro, representativeAgent=averagePersonOptimization, tractableAnalysis, noHeterogeneity

> Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models
> The separation of macro‐ and microeconomics continued until the economic crisis of the mid‐ 1970s prompted what is now known as the lucas critique. In essence, lucas (1976) pointed out that <u>policy changes would change the way people behaved and thus the structure being modelled, and this meant that existing models could not be used to evaluate policy.</u> The result was **dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dSgE)** models that attempt ‘<u>to integrate macroeconomics with microeconomics by providing microeconomic foundations for macroeconomics</u>’ (Wickens, 2008, p.xiii). This integration is achieved by including ‘**a single individual who produces a good that can either be consumed or invested to increase future output and consumption**’ (Wickens, 2008, p.2). They are known as either the Ramsey (1928 and 1927) models or as the <u>representative agent models</u>. In effect, the representative agent <u>represents an average person</u>. And this average person <u>bases their decision on optimisation</u>. The limitations of using representative agents have been long recognised (e.g. by Kirman, 1992). But they have continued to be <u>used because they make the analysis more tractable</u> (Wickens, 2008, p.10). However, this is changing. Wickens noted in 2008 (2008, p.10) that ‘<u>more advanced treatments of macroeconomic problems often allow for heterogeneity</u>’, and the technical problems of using heterogeneous agents in dSgE models are now (in 2014) being addressed in cutting‐edge research projects.

#### Economics of ABM: non-linear and complex phenomena, which is never really in equilibrium state 

> Complexity economics
> Not all economists think that the dSgE models are the right way to proceed. For example, in 2006, Colander published Post Walrasian Macroeconomics: Beyond the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model, a collection of papers that set out the agenda for <u>an alternative approach</u> to macroeconomics that did not make the restrictive assumptions found in dSgE models and in particular did <u>not assume that people operated in an information‐rich environment</u>.
>
> The dSgE approach assumes that <u>the economy is capable of reaching and sustaining an equilibrium</u>, although there is <u>much debate about how equilibrium is defined</u>. Others take the view that <u>the economy is a non‐linear, complex dynamic system which rarely, if ever, reaches equilibrium</u> (see, e.g. Arthur, 2014). While in a linear system, macro level activity amounts to a simple adding up of the micro actions, in a non‐linear system, something new may emerge. Arthur (1999) concluded:
>
> After two centuries of studying equilibria – static patterns that call for no further behavioral adjustments – economists are beginning to study the general emergence of structures and the unfolding of patterns in the economy. When viewed in out‐of‐ equilibrium formation, economic patterns sometimes simplify into the simple static equilibria of standard economics. More often they are ever changing, showing perpetually novel behavior and emergent phenomena.
>
> Furthermore, ‘Complex dynamical systems full of non‐linearities and sundry time lags have been completely beyond the state of the arts until rather recently’, but ‘<u>agent‐based simulations make it possible to investigate problems that Marshall and Keynes could only “talk” about</u>’ (leijonhufvud, 2006). More recently, Stiglitz and gallegati (2011) have pointed out that <u>use of the representative agent ‘rules out the possibility of the analysis of complex interactions</u>’; and they ‘advocate a bottom‐up approach, where high‐level (macroeconomic) systems may possess new and different properties than the low‐level (microeconomic) systems on which they are based’. ABM is therefore seen by many as offering a way forward.



#### DSGE vs ABM = computationalComplexAgentSimpleEnv vs simpleBehaviorAgentComplexEnv

> Howitt (2012) suggested that agent‐based economic models are ‘the polar opposite to that of dSgE’. dSgE models in effect assume that ‘<u>people have an incredibly sophisticated ability to solve a computationally challenging intertemporal planning problem in an incredibly simple environment</u>’, while agent‐based models assume that ‘<u>people have very simple rules of behavior for coping with an environment that is too complex for anyone fully to understand</u>’. In short, Howitt argued that agent‐based economic models can portray an economic system in which orderly behaviour can emerge as a result of interaction between heterogeneous agents, none of whom has any understanding of how the overall system functions.

#### DSGE vs ABM = Full Info vs Constraints, MistakeNoRepeat vs stochastic-MistakeRepeat-LearningAlgo 

> In agent‐based models, <u>agents follow rules and react and interact over time</u>. They may well be <u>optimising</u>, but it is <u>within their perceived constraints</u>, and they may <u>not have full information</u>. In contrast, **neoclassical** economics assumes people can <u>optimise using full information</u> (see, e.g. Axtell, 2007). In particular, in agent‐based models, agents <u>cannot foresee the future</u> because it is determined by **stochastic** processes. And they <u>may correct</u> their behaviour following <u>a mistake or not</u>, depending on the **learning algorithm** used. <u>dSgE</u> models assume <u>mistakes are not repeated</u>.
> The book focuses on using agent‐based models to provide:
> •  The possibility of modelling **heterogeneity**
> •  An easy way to address **dynamics**
> •  The opportunity to **model interactions** between people and between people and their environment
> We now take a brief look at each of these.

#### Early Key Economists don't use fancy math and models 

> The Method I take to do this, is not yet very usual; for instead of using only compar- ative and superlative Words, and intellectual Arguments, I have taken the course (as a Specimen of the Political Arithmetick I have long aimed at) to express my self in Terms of Number, Weight, or Measure; to use only Arguments of Sense, and to consider only such Causes, as have visible Foundations in Nature.
> Sir William Petty (1690)
> Whether Sir William Petty was the first economic modeller is arguable. Was Quesnay’s Tableau Economique dated 1767 the first macroeconomic model? Or Ricardo’s 1821 model of a farm the first microeconomic model? (Those interested in these early models should read Morgan, 2012, pp.3–8.) Nevertheless, books of political economy such as <u>Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1776) or Marshall’s Principles of Economics (1920) had **no modelling or mathematics**</u>. There is **almost none** in <u>Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936).</u>  p. 2

#### macroeconomic models : a set of equations and law of aggregates and averages 

> Traditional macroeconomic models
> For our purposes, we shall start with the <u>macroeconomic models produced in the 1930s by Frisch and Tinbergen</u> (Morgan, 2012, p.10). These models comprised <u>a set of equations relying on correlations between time series generated from the national accounts</u>. There was no formal link between these macroeconomic models and microeconomic analysis despite the traditional view that ‘<u>the laws of the aggregate depend of course upon the laws applying to individual cases’</u> (Jevons, 1888, Chapter 3, para 20). Not all saw benefit in these new models. For example, Hayek (1931, p.5) wrote:
> ...<u>neither aggregates nor averages do act upon each other, and it will never be possible to establish necessary connections of cause and effect between them</u> as we can between individual phenomena, individual prices, etc. I would even go as far as to assert that, from the very nature of economic theory, averages can never form a link in its reasoning.
> Nevertheless, macroeconomics became identified as separate field from microeconomics with the publication of Samuelson’s Economics in 1948 (Colander, 2006, p.52). p. 2

#### DSGE : microFoundationMacro, representativeAgent=averagePersonOptimization, tractableAnalysis, noHeterogeneity

> Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models
> The separation of macro‐ and microeconomics continued until the economic crisis of the mid‐ 1970s prompted what is now known as the lucas critique. In essence, lucas (1976) pointed out that <u>policy changes would change the way people behaved and thus the structure being modelled, and this meant that existing models could not be used to evaluate policy.</u> The result was **dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dSgE)** models that attempt ‘<u>to integrate macroeconomics with microeconomics by providing microeconomic foundations for macroeconomics</u>’ (Wickens, 2008, p.xiii). This integration is achieved by including ‘**a single individual who produces a good that can either be consumed or invested to increase future output and consumption**’ (Wickens, 2008, p.2). They are known as either the Ramsey (1928 and 1927) models or as the <u>representative agent models</u>. In effect, the representative agent <u>represents an average person</u>. And this average person <u>bases their decision on optimisation</u>. The limitations of using representative agents have been long recognised (e.g. by Kirman, 1992). But they have continued to be <u>used because they make the analysis more tractable</u> (Wickens, 2008, p.10). However, this is changing. Wickens noted in 2008 (2008, p.10) that ‘<u>more advanced treatments of macroeconomic problems often allow for heterogeneity</u>’, and the technical problems of using heterogeneous agents in dSgE models are now (in 2014) being addressed in cutting‐edge research projects.

#### Economics of ABM: non-linear and complex phenomena, which is never really in equilibrium state 

> Complexity economics
> Not all economists think that the dSgE models are the right way to proceed. For example, in 2006, Colander published Post Walrasian Macroeconomics: Beyond the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model, a collection of papers that set out the agenda for <u>an alternative approach</u> to macroeconomics that did not make the restrictive assumptions found in dSgE models and in particular did <u>not assume that people operated in an information‐rich environment</u>.
>
> The dSgE approach assumes that <u>the economy is capable of reaching and sustaining an equilibrium</u>, although there is <u>much debate about how equilibrium is defined</u>. Others take the view that <u>the economy is a non‐linear, complex dynamic system which rarely, if ever, reaches equilibrium</u> (see, e.g. Arthur, 2014). While in a linear system, macro level activity amounts to a simple adding up of the micro actions, in a non‐linear system, something new may emerge. Arthur (1999) concluded:
>
> After two centuries of studying equilibria – static patterns that call for no further behavioral adjustments – economists are beginning to study the general emergence of structures and the unfolding of patterns in the economy. When viewed in out‐of‐ equilibrium formation, economic patterns sometimes simplify into the simple static equilibria of standard economics. More often they are ever changing, showing perpetually novel behavior and emergent phenomena.
>
> Furthermore, ‘Complex dynamical systems full of non‐linearities and sundry time lags have been completely beyond the state of the arts until rather recently’, but ‘<u>agent‐based simulations make it possible to investigate problems that Marshall and Keynes could only “talk” about</u>’ (leijonhufvud, 2006). More recently, Stiglitz and gallegati (2011) have pointed out that <u>use of the representative agent ‘rules out the possibility of the analysis of complex interactions</u>’; and they ‘advocate a bottom‐up approach, where high‐level (macroeconomic) systems may possess new and different properties than the low‐level (microeconomic) systems on which they are based’. ABM is therefore seen by many as offering a way forward.



#### DSGE vs ABM = computationalComplexAgentSimpleEnv vs simpleBehaviorAgentComplexEnv

> Howitt (2012) suggested that agent‐based economic models are ‘the polar opposite to that of dSgE’. dSgE models in effect assume that ‘<u>people have an incredibly sophisticated ability to solve a computationally challenging intertemporal planning problem in an incredibly simple environment</u>’, while agent‐based models assume that ‘<u>people have very simple rules of behavior for coping with an environment that is too complex for anyone fully to understand</u>’. In short, Howitt argued that agent‐based economic models can portray an economic system in which orderly behaviour can emerge as a result of interaction between heterogeneous agents, none of whom has any understanding of how the overall system functions.

#### DSGE vs ABM = Full Info vs Constraints, MistakeNoRepeat vs stochastic-MistakeRepeat-LearningAlgo 

> In agent‐based models, <u>agents follow rules and react and interact over time</u>. They may well be <u>optimising</u>, but it is <u>within their perceived constraints</u>, and they may <u>not have full information</u>. In contrast, **neoclassical** economics assumes people can <u>optimise using full information</u> (see, e.g. Axtell, 2007). In particular, in agent‐based models, agents <u>cannot foresee the future</u> because it is determined by **stochastic** processes. And they <u>may correct</u> their behaviour following <u>a mistake or not</u>, depending on the **learning algorithm** used. <u>dSgE</u> models assume <u>mistakes are not repeated</u>.
> The book focuses on using agent‐based models to provide:
> •  The possibility of modelling **heterogeneity**
> •  An easy way to address **dynamics**
> •  The opportunity to **model interactions** between people and between people and their environment
> We now take a brief look at each of these.



#### conventionalEconomicModelVariablesNoHeterogeneity vs ABMvariablesHeterogeneity

> Traditional approaches to economics have long been criticised for <u>‘lumping’ things together</u>. Think, for example, of a **Cobb–douglas production function** in which <u>two variables, labour and capital</u>, are combined to produce output. Clearly, there are different types of labour and different types of capital, and one kind cannot replace another overnight: a bricklayer cannot just become a software designer, nor vice versa, and a factory producing cars cannot produce computer chips. Nor are all consumers the same: a rich household will have a very different spending pattern to a poor household. Some must save so that others can borrow. Indeed, <u>without heterogeneity, there would be no scope for trading</u>. **ABM allows for such heterogeneity to be represented explicitly** and without causing insuperable complications.



#### DynamicsAdaptiveProcess = compareStaticsEquilibriumInadequate = modelDynamicsMathUnmanageable

> By <u>dynamics</u>, we here refer to **adaptive processes**, which, according to leijonhufvud (2006), is the sense in which it was originally used in economics. Most economic textbooks <u>only use comparative statics</u>, that is, <u>compare equilibrium situations</u>. yet as long ago as 1941, Samuelson pointed out that <u>comparative statics were inadequate for the analysis of a range of economic problems</u> (Samuelson, 1941). But as the examination of any basic economics textbook will show, <u>comparative statics still dominates teaching</u>. The question of <u>how the economy moves from one equilibrium to another is not addressed</u>. This is only now starting to change under the auspices of CORE, which gives prominence to dynamics (CORE, 2014). However, **modelling dynamics by traditional methods is difficult as the mathematics quickly become unmanageable**. <u>using ABM, simple rules can be applied and tested through simulation.</u>

#### economicsMarketsBasedOnInteractions

> People influence each other’s behaviour. <u>Herd behaviour is common in economics</u>; people copy fashion, and markets take flight. Indeed, <u>markets are based on interactions</u>: sellers and buyers trade. <u>The traditional economic models do not allow for this kind of interaction, but it is easily modelled using agents</u>. ABM can also model in a simple manner how people can interact with the environment, for example, using up scarce resources.

#### ABMwithTopicsMoreAppropriate : trade, market, reserve banking system

> It is clearly impossible to cover everything presented in standard economics textbooks, which typically run to hundreds of pages (e.g. the British Begg et al.’s Economics (2011) and, from the united States, Varian’s Intermediate Economics (2010)). So we have <u>chosen topics within areas that seem to be particularly suitable for ABM, that is, where heterogeneity, interaction and dynamics are important.</u>
> Markets are a key theme of this book. We start with consumer choice in Chapter 3 and include fashion dynamics in Chapter 4 before introducing markets, through barter, in Chapter 5 with a fuller development in Chapter 6. The later chapters cover markets in the contexts of labour in Chapter 7 and international trade in Chapter 8. We have deliberately avoided discussion of financial markets as the usefulness of ABM has already been well established in this area by <u>leBaron (2006) and others</u>. But Chapter 9 demonstrates the potentially explosive dynamics of the fractional reserve banking system. Chapter 10 shows how ABM can be used to model not only the interaction between economic agents but the interaction between agents and their natural environment.

#### findCheapestShopModel to learn NetLogo

> Chapter 2 shows how to create a simple agent‐based model and introduces the programming environment, Netlogo, that will be used for the models described in the rest of the book. The model simulates consumers shopping for fruit and vegetables in a produce market. The consumer agents are initially programmed to <u>choose a market stall to purchase from at random</u>, and then <u>successive enhancements are made to record the cost of purchases</u>, to <u>stop them revisiting a stall they have previously been to and to try to find the cheapest stalls to buy from</u>. Many of the basic building blocks of Netlogo programming are described.

#### agentHouseholds : replicateIncomeDistribution, Cobb-douglas utilityFunction, priceChangeByDemand, compareRepresentativeAgentHeterogeneousAgent

> Chapter 3 introduces ABM by showing how it can be used to create heterogeneous agents whose characteristics and behaviour can be summed to generate observed macro patterns. Three models are presented in which <u>agents represent households</u>. The first model <u>generates a budget distribution to replicate the observed distribution of income</u> in the united Kingdom. The second adds <u>a Cobb–douglas utility function</u> to draw both individual and aggregate demand curves and demonstrates how consumers’ choices can be <u>tracked from their preferences to their contribution to aggregate demand</u>. The third model provides a practical way of examining the <u>effect on demand of price changes</u>. Finally, the chapter <u>compares</u> the results from these simple models using <u>heterogeneous agents with those from a ‘representative agent’ analysis</u>.

#### agentInfluencedByPriceIncomeOthersActions, modelSocialNetworks, thresholdModels, adoptationNewProduct

> Chapter 4 adds <u>interaction between agents and dynamics</u>. Consumers’ behaviour is now not just <u>influenced by prices and incomes but also by what others do</u>, especially family and friends. ABM is well suited to <u>modelling such social networks</u>, and the first model in this chapter does this very simply using the concept of <u>social circles</u>. Next, we introduce <u>threshold models</u> and show how these can be combined with the <u>social network model to examine possible adoption patterns of new products</u>. The chapter then reviews the <u>adoption of new technology by households</u> in the united Kingdom and finally presents a case study of the <u>adoption of fixed‐line phones in the united Kingdom from 1951 to 2001</u>.

#### BenefitBarter = dynamicsTrading + stochasticPeer2PeerTradingMechanism

> Chapter 5 demonstrates how ABM allows us to <u>explore the dynamics of heterogeneous agents interacting by trading.</u> using the **two‐good economy** much beloved of economics textbooks, agents trade by barter. We model an exchange economy broadly based on a description of trading that occurred in a <u>prisoner‐of‐war camp</u>. We start by creating a model that <u>reproduces the Edgeworth Box to tease out the essentials of the barter process between two individuals.</u> We explore the effectiveness of <u>different price setting mechanisms</u> in clearing the market and achieving Pareto optimality, starting with the <u>theoretical Walrasian auctioneer</u>. Then we extend this model to allow 200 agents to trade. We show that <u>a simple stochastic peer‐to‐peer trading mechanism can produce a large increase in welfare</u>, even if total utility is not maximised.

#### dynamicsInteractiveMarket = duopoly-NashEquilibrium-InaccurateInfo + smallShop-CompetitionSurvival-ForesightLimited + digitBusinessNoLimit

> Chapter 6 focuses on the decisions of firms and demonstrates how ABM can easily <u>accommodate the dynamic and interactive nature of markets</u>. We present three models. The first is based on Cournot’s classic model of <u>duopoly and its Nash equilibrium</u> but introduces the possibility of <u>inaccurate information</u>. The second model is based on small shops in the real world that do not have the benefit of the <u>perfect foresight</u> that is granted to firms operating <u>under perfect competition</u> and illustrates the <u>dynamics of survival</u>. The final model reflects business in the digital world, where there is no limit on capacity.

#### HeterogeneityDynamicsLaborMarket = distributionWage + skewDistributionFirmSize + flowsWorkers = combineMicroMacro

> <u>Heterogeneity and dynamics</u> are the central themes of Chapter 7. The united Kingdom labour market is characterised by <u>large flows and great diversity among the participants</u>. The chapter starts with a model to generate the <u>distribution of wages</u>. It then adds the interaction between employers and workers as employers <u>try to fill vacancies and workers seek jobs</u>, touching briefly on the <u>very skew distribution of firms by size</u>. Finally, the various <u>flows of workers between employers and into and out of the labour force</u> are added to produce a simple, but interesting, model of the labour market of a small town. It also shows <u>how micro and macro aspects can be combined in one model.</u>

#### InternationalTradeExchangeRate = 5countries2FloatingRate3Eurozone + inflation-Depreciation-Demand-FiscalChange

> Chapter 8 presents a simple model of trade between one country and the rest of the world, focusing on the determination of exchange rates. Five countries are used as examples, <u>two with floating exchange rates and three in the Eurozone</u>. Four scenarios are examined: <u>inflation, depreciation, exogenous change in demand for exports and the impact of fiscal policy changes</u>. The model focuses on dynamics. Even this simple model serves to highlight the <u>difficulty of modelling the dynamics of international trade</u>. It also shows clearly the constraints under which Eurozone countries operate.

#### fractionalReserveBanking = saverBorrower + dynamicProcesses

> Chapter 9 uses a simple agent‐based model to explore the basic features of <u>fractional reserve banking</u> and shows how the reserve and capital adequacy ratios imposed by regulators can dampen an otherwise explosive system. It illustrates how ABM can accommodate heterogeneity in that both <u>savers and borrowers</u> can be represented; how micro and macro aspects can be combined in one model, unlike the conventional textbook treatment of banking; and the importance of <u>taking dynamic processes fully into account in modelling the banking system.</u>

#### TragedyCommons : noRestrictionTragedy + setLimitAvoidTragedy

> Chapter 10 demonstrates how ABM can handle the interaction of agents with their environment as well as with one another by addressing the <u>problem of the overuse of shared resources</u>. In the ‘**tragedy of the commons**’, <u>the pursuit of self‐interest results in overuse of a common pool resource to the detriment of all</u>. A model, inspired by English common land, is built in two stages. First, a meadow is created and its carrying capacity established. Then commoners are introduced. If there are no restrictions on the number of cows grazed on the meadow, there is overgrazing and ‘the tragedy’ ensues. But by following actual practice observed in England and Switzerland of <u>setting limits on the number each commoner is allowed to graze</u>, the model demonstrates that the tragedy can be avoided. The model can be readily adapted to accommodate other scenarios.

> Chapter 11: Summary and conclusions
> The final chapter summarises the models to show how ABM has addressed the weaknesses in the existing methods identified in Section 1.2 by allowing heterogeneity, facilitating dynamics and modelling interactions between people and their environments and thereby improving the link between micro‐ and macroeconomics. It also sets out some of the problems that need to be addressed in order for ABM’s potential to make a useful contribution to economics to be fully realised.
> We present 19 models in Chapters 3–10, ranging from modules to be used in larger models to a real‐world model. In each case, we follow Müller et al. (2014) who suggested ‘a structured natural language description plus the provision of source code’ as being ‘particularly suited for academic purposes’. We describe the models in natural language in the chapters. The appendices to the chapters provide more details based on the <u>Odd (Overview, design concepts, and details) protocol</u> (grimm et al., 2010) and include pseudocode. The code itself is provided on the website http://cress.soc.surrey.ac.uk/.

## Starting agent‐based modelling

socialScientists should learn, understand and program codes of models

> While it is possible just to use an agent‐based model that someone else has developed, it is much better and more interesting to see what goes on ‘under the hood’, so that you can see and understand the program code that is making the model work. <u>Learning how to program, as well as being a worthwhile exercise in its own right, will allow you to modify existing programs, for example, to explore the effect of different settings and different assumptions, and eventually to build your own programs.</u> Programming used to be a matter for experts, requiring many months of study or a degree in computer science. Fortunately, advances in programming languages and interfaces have meant that programming is becoming ever more easily accessible to those without expert knowledge. In this book, we use a programming system called NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999) that was originally designed for secondary (high) school pupils and is still used, particularly in the United States, to teach science by means of simulations. The origins of NetLogo mean that a great deal of attention has been paid to making the NetLogo system easy to use and to understand. We will take advantage of that in this book, and we will also benefit from the fact that NetLogo is especially good for developing agent‐based models. The authors describe it as a ‘multi‐agent programmable modelling environment’.

## A simple market: the basic model

#### dynamicsSimpleProduceMarket

> Much of this book is about modelling markets of different types. one of the simplest is a produce market, such as is often found in towns and cities selling fruits and vegetables. In this model, there are shoppers, each with a shopping list, and a number of market stalls, each selling a range of fruits and vegetables. The shoppers want to buy the items on their lists, which will differ from one shopper to the next, and may want to minimise the cost of their shopping. The stallholders sell their produce for different prices, depending on what they think the customers will pay, the prices that they paid in a wholesale market and other factors. Not all stalls sell the complete range of fruits and vegetables.

#### rebuildModelsFromScratch + verificationAtEachStep

> The model described so far is intentionally rather simple to make it easier to explain the general structure of agent‐based models. As you may have noticed, it does not include any economic variables as yet. But once a basic model is working, it can be modified and enhanced with further details, and often, this is the best way to develop models: one stage at a time. Indeed, it is very important to check that a model is doing what you intended as you develop it. **If this process, called verification, is left until the model is large and complicated, it may well be almost impossible to do**. NetLogo makes this approach to development easy because it is simple to edit a program and see the effect of changes.

#### simpleABM = heterogeneousAgent + dynamicsWithoutEquilibrium + interaction + rationalityWithLimit = modelMarketChap2

> The agents were heterogeneous: <u>the range of fruits and vegetables stocked differed between market traders,</u> and every shopper had <u>a different shopping list</u>. consequently, <u>the behaviour of each agent differed</u>. The **dynamics** of the system were important: there is **no notion of equilibrium** in the model, but we can <u>observe agents proceeding through time to purchase their shopping</u>. Thirdly, the agents **interacted**: <u>shoppers bought from traders</u>. Furthermore, agents were endowed with some **rationality** that allowed them to attempt to **optimise but within constraints** imposed by <u>limited information and limited resources of time and effort.</u>

#### correlationRequreMultipleRuns

> **The amount of scanning that agents do to find the cheapest stalls should be correlated with a reduction in the average price that they pay: the more they search, the more likely that they will find the optimum set of prices.** However, <u>it is not easy to see</u> this by running the model once for each of several values of the n‐scans slider. This is because the prices of the fruits and vegetables, the markups that the traders apply, the range of stock that each stall has, the shoppers’ lists of what to buy and the choices of stalls to visit <u>all vary randomly from run to run</u>, and <u>all affect the average price paid</u>. This is typical of many <u>agent‐based models</u>. They are <u>stochastic, with behaviour that varies randomly</u>. The usual method of assessing such models is to run them many times and take the average of the outcomes. (How many is enough runs to yield a reliable average can be complicated to work out, but as a guide, it is **useful to calculate the standard deviation of the mean and continue the runs until this is no longer reducing**).
>
> Let us assume that 100 runs is enough. We should run the model 100 times with the agents each scanning one route, find the average price of the agents’ shopping lists, then repeat for another 100 times with the agents scanning for the best of two routes and so on. This will clearly require running the model several hundred times, and it would be impracticable to do this manually, pressing the setup and go buttons and calculating the average of the runs hundreds of times. Fortunately, NetLogo can do the work for us. Since both setup and go are procedures, we can write some additional code that calls these procedures and calculates the desired mean of the average cost of the shopping baskets (see Box 2.5).

# Introduction

## Artificial Society Models

> Conventional Modeling problem
>
> - suppress real world heterogeneity directly in macroeconomics and indirectly in aggregate models to represent social sciences.
> - game theory and general equilibrium theory, has been preoccupied with static equilibria, and has essentially ignored time dynamics. 
>
> ABM approach
>
> - Our broad aim is to begin the development of a computational approach that permits the study of these diverse spheres of human activity from an **evolutionary** perspective as a single social science, a **transdisdpline** subsuming such fields as economics and demography.
> - In this approach fundamental social structures and group behaviors emerge from the interaction of individuals operating in artificial environments under rules that place only bounded demands on each agent's information and computational capacity. We view **artificial societies as laboratories**, where we attempt to grow certain social structures in the computer- or in silico- the aim being to discover fundamental local or micro mechanisms that are sufficient to generate the macroscopic social structures and collective behaviors of interest.
>
> Micro-simulation vs ABM 
>
> - In comparison to agent-basedmodeling, micro -simulation has more of a "top-down" character since it models behavior via equations statistically estimated from aggregate data, not as resulting from simple local rules

## Agents

> Agents are the "people" of anifidal societies. Each agent has internal states and behavioral rules. Some states are fixed for the agent's life, while others change through interaction with other agents or with the external environment. 

## Environment

>the "environment" is a medium separate from the agents, on which the agents operate and with which they interact.

## Rule

> There are rules of behavior for the agents and for sites of the environment. Rules couples agents and sites of environment together, having them interact with each other. 
>
> There are agent-environment rules, environment-environment rules, agent-agent rules.

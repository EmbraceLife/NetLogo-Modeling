#### How economists think or study the real world?

> CORE teaches students to be economists:
>
> - Start with a question, and look at the evidence.
> - Build a model that helps you understand what you see.
> - Critically evaluate the model: does it provide insight into the question, and explain the evidence?

# Unit 1 Capitalist Revolution

#### Capitalism : increasedLivingStandard private property, market, firms, technologyAdvance, specializingProduction, pollution, inequality

> [How capitalism revolutionized the way we live, and how economics attempts to understand this and other economic systems](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/01.html#subheadline)
>
> - Since the 1700s, increases in <u>average living standards</u> became a permanent feature of economic life in many countries.
> - This was associated with the emergence of a new economic system called <u>capitalism</u>, in which <u>private property, markets and firms</u> play a major role.
> - Under this new way of organizing the economy, <u>advances in technology and specialization</u> in products and tasks raised the amount that could be produced in a day’s work.
> - This process, which we call the capitalist revolution, has been accompanied by <u>growing threats to our natural environment</u>, and by <u>unprecedented global economic inequalities.</u>
> - Economics is the study of how people interact with each other, and with the natural environment, in producing their livelihoods.

#### GDP per capita : totalValueProduced / population = averageIncomeAnnual = grossDomesticIncome/population

> [Figure 1.1a](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/01.html#figure-1-1a) tells some of the story. To <u>compare living standards in each country</u>, we use a measure called **GDP per capita**. People <u>obtain their incomes by producing and selling goods and services</u>. GDP (gross domestic product) is the <u>total value of everything produced in a given period</u> such as a year, so <u>GDP per capita corresponds here to average annual income</u>. GDP is also referred to as <u>gross domestic income</u>. In [Figure 1.1a](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/01.html#figure-1-1a) the height of each line is <u>an estimate of average income</u> at the date on the horizontal axis.

#### Maddison Project : World GDP comparison throughout history in Excel and Document

> On average, people are six times better off in Britain than in India by this measure. Japanese people are as rich as the British, just as they were in the fourteenth century, but now Americans are even better off than the Japanese, and Norwegians are better off still.
>
> We can draw the graph in [Figure 1.1a](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/01.html#figure-1-1a) because of [the work of Angus Maddison](http://tinyco.re/4376799) who dedicated his working life to finding the scarce data needed to make useful comparisons of how people lived across more than 1,000 years (his work is continuing in [the Maddison Project](http://tinyco.re/9843804)). In this course you will see that data like this about regions of the world, and the people in it, is the starting point of all economics. In our video, the economists James Heckman and Thomas Piketty explain how collecting data has been fundamental to their work on inequality and the policies to reduce it.
